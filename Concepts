Cassandra DB 
ðŸ”¹ What is Cassandra?
Itâ€™s a NoSQL database, specifically a wide-column store (not a document database).

Designed for massive scalability, high availability, and write-heavy workloads.

Inspired by Google Bigtable and Amazon Dynamo.

Uses CQL (Cassandra Query Language) â€” SQL-like syntax, but limited features (e.g., no joins).

ðŸ”¹ Wide-Column Store
Rows can have a different set of columns â†’ flexible, sparse schema.

Best for time-series, event logs, or massive user activity feeds.

Example:

Row 1: temperature, humidity
Row 2: temperature
Row 3: humidity, light
