1 They represent the physical map as a graph

2 They compute ETA by finding the shortest path in a directed weighted graph

3 They don't use Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm because it won't scale with O(n*logn) time complexity

4 They partition the graph and then precompute the best path within each partition

5 They reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) by partitioning graph

6 They populate the edge weights of the graph with traffic information

7 They use Kalman filter and Viterbi algorithm for map matching to find ETA accurately
